<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a computer engineering university student, currently studying at Islamic Azad University Science and Research
  branch. I finished highschool in 2021, at the age of 18, and got accepted to the university right after. I've been looking towards
  learning new skills related to the field of my study, thus I've started my web development learning journey with the help of online
  courses. Apart from the arbitrary online skill learning, I've done a few projects regarding to the university. I've also written 
  an article on the subject of classical music and artificial intelligence.

<p>Another important thing to know about, is my desire for art! I enjoy drawing sketches in my free time as well as covering and 
  writing original pieces with my ukulele. Last but not least, I am a proffessional classical violin player and have been playing
  the violin for almost 12 years now.</p>
